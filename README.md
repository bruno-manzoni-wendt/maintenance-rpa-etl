# Modular RPA to ETL Maitanence data

A modular RPA/ETL in Python to extract Maintenance data from a web app to visualize in a Qlik Sense Dashboard.

## STAR SUMMARY

SITUATION:
The Maintenance Department relied on a web app called “Checklist” for technicians to log Corrective, Preventive, Predictive and others maintenance activities. However, the tool lacked visualization and was not integrated into the company’s data warehouse. As a result, the manager had to manually export data and build reports in Excel, which was time-consuming.

TASK:
Automate data extraction and transformation from the web app and connect to a Qlik Sense dashboard.

ACTION:
Developed a modular Python-based RPA/ETL to extract and transform 9 tables of maintenance data from the web app and connect it into Qlik Sense. Designed KPIs and created a Technician Scoring System to evaluate performance.

RESULTS:
Enabled an automated, daily updated Qlik Sense dashboard that replaced manual reporting and improved data reliability. Delivered a solution more than a year and a half before official data warehouse integration, providing management with early visibility into maintenance performance and valuable insights.
